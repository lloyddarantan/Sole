## 📦 Package Manager & Development Commands

Sole uses **pnpm** to manage project dependencies and **Vite** to run the frontend development server. ESLint is used to identify potential errors and maintain code quality.

### 🛠️ Installation

#### 1. Install pnpm

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm -v
```

#### 2. Install Project Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 3. Install Vite
```bash
pnpm add -D vite
```

#### 4. Install ESLint
```bash
pnpm add -D eslint @eslint/js typescript-eslint
pnpm add -D eslint-plugin-react-hooks eslint-plugin-react-refresh
```

#### 5. Install Prettier
```bash
pnpm add -D prettier
pnpm add -D eslint-config-prettier
```

#### 6. Install TailwindCSS
```bash
pnpm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vit
```
#### 7. Install Routing
```bash
pnpm add react-router-dom lucide-react
```

#### 7. Install React
```bash
pnpm add react react-dom
pnpm add -D @types/react @types/react-dom
```

#### 9. Connection to Database
```bash
pnpm add @supabase/supabase-js
```
Create .env file and include this lines:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_supabase_publishable_key
```

### 🚀 Development Commands

Run these commands inside the frontend project directory.

| **Command** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| `pnpm install` | Install project dependencies |
| `pnpm dev` | Start the Vite development server, if configured in `package.json` |
| `pnpm build` | Build the project for production, if configured |
| `pnpm lint` | Run ESLint, if configured |
| `pnpm add <package>` | Install a production dependency |
| `pnpm add -D <package>` | Install a development dependency |
| `pnpm remove <package>` | Remove a dependency |
| `pnpm update` | Update dependencies within the allowed version ranges |

### 🧹 ESLint Commands

Check the project for linting issues:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

If no `lint` script exists in `package.json`, you can run ESLint directly:

```bash
pnpm exec eslint .
```

Automatically fix supported linting issues:

```bash
pnpm exec eslint . --fix
```
Review the changes after running automatic fixes before committing your code.

### Run Prettier
| **Command** | **Purpose** |
|---|---|
| `pnpm format` | Format supported project files automatically |
| `pnpm format:check` | Check formatting without changing files |

---
## 📜 Git Workflow & Commit Conventions
